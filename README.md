# 😀 SmileLulz here! 

I'm an indie game developer passionate about making simple, fun, and replayable games that anyone can enjoy. I focus on small-scope with a minimalist aesthetic. My current projects are available for Android only, but with plans for iOS and PC in the future.

🎮 I create:
- Pixel-art or low-asset games with clean mechanics
- Singleplayer experiences - multiplayer may come later
